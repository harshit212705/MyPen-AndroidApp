# MyPen-AndroidApp
* An Android application that converts the hand-writing of a person into digital fonts. It allows users to draw all characters as well as all the special symbols in their own handwriting. The app stores the user templates and the user can modify them as and when required. Users can generate pdf documents in their own handwriting by giving a text file as input.
